### Virtual Hosting
[10] is a good read on Virtual Hosting. We have Name, IP , Port based Virtual Hostings.
## Linux

we are on linux.
```
#install the apache2 server

## Apache2

Follow instructions on [4] which is good. [2] really helps you to create the self signed certificates simply. [4] and [3] help but not so much.

## Mysql Server or any popular sql server not necessarily mysql pshh!

### Mariadb [8]
one good choice. [7] shows how to get tit for ubuntu.

Further I would call any development suite of stack of software components for web application development as `LAMP mock <something>`.
if we are going down the road of lamp instances.

for example
```
LAMP mock Linux Weblogic Postgres Java
```
